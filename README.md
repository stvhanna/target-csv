# target-csv

A [Singer](https://singer.io) target that writes data to CSV files.

## How to use it

`target-csv` works together with any other [Singer Tap] to move data
from sources like [Braintree], [Freshdesk] and [Hubspot] to
CSV-formatted files. It is commonly used for loading data into tools
like Excel or simply storing a backup of the source data set.

### Install and Run

First, make sure Python 3 is installed on your system or follow these
installation instructions for [Mac] or
[Ubuntu].


It's recommended to use a virtualenv:

```bash
 python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/target-csv
 source ~/.virtualenvs/target-csv/bin/activate
 pip install -U pip setuptools
 pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

`target-csv` can be run with any [Singer Tap], but we'll use
[`tap-fixerio`][Fixerio] - which pulls currency exchange rate data
from a public data set - as an example.

These commands will install `tap-fixerio` and `target-csv` with pip,
and then run them together, piping the output of `tap-fixerio` to
`target-csv`:

```bash
› pip install target-csv tap-fixerio
› tap-fixerio | target-csv
  INFO Replicating the latest exchange rate data from fixer.io
  INFO Tap exiting normally
```

The data will be written to a file called `exchange_rate.csv` in your
working directory.

```bash
› cat exchange_rate.csv
AUD,BGN,BRL,CAD,CHF,CNY,CZK,DKK,GBP,HKD,HRK,HUF,IDR,ILS,INR,JPY,KRW,MXN,MYR,NOK,NZD,PHP,PLN,RON,RUB,SEK,SGD,THB,TRY,ZAR,EUR,USD,date
1.3023,1.8435,3.0889,1.3109,1.0038,6.869,25.47,7.0076,0.79652,7.7614,7.0011,290.88,13317.0,3.6988,66.608,112.21,1129.4,19.694,4.4405,8.3292,1.3867,50.198,4.0632,4.2577,58.105,8.9724,1.4037,34.882,3.581,12.915,0.9426,1.0,2017-02-24T00:00:00Z
```

If you're using a different Tap, substitute `tap-fixerio` in the final
command above to the command used to run your Tap.

### Optional Configuration

`target-csv` takes an optional configuration file that can be used to
set formatting parameters like the delimiter - see
[config.sample.json](config.sample.json) for examples. To run
`target-csv` with the configuration file, use this command:

```bash
› tap-fixerio | target-csv -c my-config.json
```
